# Rubik's Cube Solver

This repository contains a Rubik's Cube solver that uses algorithms to find the fastest possible way of solving a Rubik's Cube. Currently, the cube's state must be manually entered, but future enhancements may include using a camera to detect the unsolved cube and generating written instructions with arrows to illustrate the solution steps.

## Features

- Initializes a Rubik's Cube in its solved state.
- Supports clockwise and counterclockwise rotations for each face.
- Updates adjacent faces correctly after each rotation.
- Prints the current state of the cube for visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a camera-based detection system to automatically input the unsolved cube's state.
- Creating detailed solution instructions with arrows.
